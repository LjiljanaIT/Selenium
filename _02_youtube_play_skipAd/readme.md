Task text:
Using Selenium for Java
1) Open YouTube
2) Search for Rick Astley and play song "Never gonna give you up"
If there is an Ad on the beginning of the video, skip it.
After that, from the list of the songs on the right side ("Watch next") play first offered video.
Skip Ad again. Do the second part of the task for 5 times.

Note:
As of  ‘Skipping Ads’ part, it seems to me that one does not have this option if not logged in on YT.
And, while running Selenium Java test, you are not logged in.
In the solution that I am offering today (29/03/2020) I managed to check if there was Ad playing at the begging of the video.
I am returning this info in console. Once I manage to go around this obstacle, I will upload improved solution.
Until then, should you have any advice on this matter and willing to help, please contact me via email lj.v.kapor@gmail.com.
Thanks in advance.
