Note:
As of today, 29/03/2020, I have not been able to find a solution of the task that would use
relative path for the photo upload.
As soon as I learn how to do it, I will update a code.
Photo to be uploaded is attached to the project folder.
If trying this test, please update absolute path that applies for 
your working environment.
Should you have any advice on this matter and willing to help,
please contact me via email lj.v.kapor@gmail.com.
Thanks in advance.
